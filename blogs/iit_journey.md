### Preparation

I didn’t know what an IIT was until 10th grade. A friend told me about it, and since I was always interested in math, I thought engineering would be a good choice. Immediately after my 10th board exams, I joined a coaching center. I attended the evening batch, which meant I had a 1-2 hour class after regular school.


However, vacation classes were a full-day thing starting a week after the board exams. I wasn’t the topper or anything, and when school resumed, it was a bit tiring, but I pushed through. For my entire 11th grade, I stayed at home and attended these 5-7 pm classes. Again, I wasn’t excelling or topping the class, but I had my basics strong. A few months into 12th grade, my professor encouraged me to stay at a hostel that was closer to the coaching center—it worked wonders. I was able to study more and have a disciplined life with minimal distractions. I had a lot of extra classes and amazing professors who gave me extra attention.

In January 2020, I took the JEE Mains—I scored in the 97th percentile, which wasn’t bad, but not quite enough for getting into Computer Science at an IIT. Then the JEE Advanced classes started. They were intense, but I actually enjoyed the hustle.


But, alas, it didn’t last. Corona hit, and everything shut down. For a while, I focused on my board exams, but after they were over and I had a second chance at JEE Mains, I didn’t study much. The transition to online classes was tough, and I didn’t cope well. I’ve always been someone who needs some kind of external motivation.


Fast forward to September, when I retook the JEE Mains—I ended up with around the same score. From there, I did try to study for JEE Advanced, but I only had time for revision. So, when the results came in, I ended up with a similar score.
